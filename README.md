Code snippets to review in LU

From a server comes regularly a message this message is saved with the saveLiveCount function.

Every hour the saveDailyCounts function is executed and saves the current count from the livecount

Every day the saveWeekly and saveMonthly function are called to take the consumption of the day and save it in their own table.

The logic of those function are kind of similar so you could pick one or two if you think one fits better to the LU than another or review all if you think it makes sense.

Look in the master branch, for some reasons the commits went there.
